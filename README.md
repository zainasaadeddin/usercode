AWS Amplify is an Amazon service that helps to quickly build and deploy full-stack mobile and web applications. It also provides a CLI toolchain that allows for deployment directly from the IDE without going to the AWS Management Console.


In this AWS Cloud Lab, you’ll learn to use the AWS Amplify CLI service to create and deploy back-end services on the AWS Cloud. You’ll even get to connect these back-end services with a React web application and host it on the AWS Cloud. You’ll deploy an entire end-to-end web application from the VS Code IDE on the AWS Cloud.
The following is the high-level architecture diagram of the infrastructure you’ll create in our Cloud Lab:
