AWS Amplify is an Amazon service that helps to quickly build and deploy full-stack mobile and web applications. It also provides a CLI toolchain that allows for deployment directly from the IDE without going to the AWS Management Console.


In this AWS Cloud Lab, you’ll learn to use the AWS Amplify CLI service to create and deploy back-end services on the AWS Cloud. You’ll even get to connect these back-end services with a React web application and host it on the AWS Cloud. You’ll deploy an entire end-to-end web application from the VS Code IDE on the AWS Cloud.
The following is the high-level architecture diagram of the infrastructure you’ll create in our Cloud Lab:

AWS Amplify is an Amazon service that helps to quickly build, deploy, and host full-stack mobile and web applications on the AWS Cloud. It offers a comprehensive development framework that leverages a range of AWS services without requiring any prior cloud expertise because everything is done automatically for us under the hood. It also provides a CLI toolchain that allows for deployment directly from the IDE without going to the AWS Management Console. We’ll be using this CLI toolchain in this lab.

The following are some of the features of AWS Amplify:

* Back-end services: Amplify provides back-end services for authentication, APIs, databases, or storage purposes. It allows developers to seamlessly configure and set up these services without the need for extensive back-end development.

* Frontend development: Amplify offers front-end support for many popular web and mobile frameworks like React, React Native, Angular, and Flutter frameworks.
API management: Amplify allows us to easily create and manage REST and GraphQL APIs, leveraging both the API Gateway and AWS AppSync services.

* Database integration: We can easily manage data storage for our application by integrating AWS database services like Amazon DynamoDB using the Amplify service.

* Hosting and deployment: Amplify provides hosting and deployment services that enable developers to quickly deploy and host their applications on the AWS Cloud.
Serverless computations: We can integrate AWS Lambda functions with Amplify applications to perform serverless computations.
